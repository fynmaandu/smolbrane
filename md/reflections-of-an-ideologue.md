## Introduction

I would define a large component of my personal "brand", historically, as one of ideological
ramblings and lashing out at the powers that be. I've burned bridges, severed friendships, alienated
countless people, and hopefully inspired countless more. In taking time away and reflecting I think
the basis for these criticisms was wrong. The problems we face are bigger than a16z, coinbase,
paradigm; they're bigger than bank of america, blackrock, palantir. These may be the organizations
which oppose us in the moment, but our problem is not in implementation details, it is systemic.
Given the same circumstances, banks, centralized exchanges, intermediaries, these will all exist.
If not the name brands we know, then others. A bet on benevolence up the hierarchy is a bet on the
protocol with all the technicals and none of the culture. If we ejected all police officers and put
new ones in their place today, the oppression of minorities would not stop. If the president of the
united states stepped down today, the mass deportation of migrants would not stop. Our problems are
systemic. Barring some fantasy revolution where we all put down our laptops and uber eats to fight
up in the hills to magically overthrow everything and completely fix all the systemic problems that
a subsequent government would almost certainly inherit; we have to rethink how revolutionary and
radical action is taken. There's too many lives at stake, too much capital unwilling to budge, too
many institutions in too many places. If we break it we starve, so we change it and ourselves
continuously.

## Revolution as Continuous Transformation

We think of revolution as a short series of discrete, significant actions. The boston tea party, the
export of cryptography on t-shirts protected by the constitution, the black panther party for self
defense walking into the capitol of california with rifles and shotguns. Dramatic moments worthy of
cinematic re-enactment.

But this is not what revolution is. Revolution is countless small changes in our day to day which
continuously transform ourselves and the systems under which we live. For those not interested in
topology, the handwavy "continuous transformation" wording means we're not tearing apart ourselves
and "the systems", we're bending, folding, stretching, squeezing to better meet the needs of our
fellow people.

Those of us with privilege and authority under the socioeconomic order find ourselves with the
responsibility to start the revolution where we are. This is in speaking out about injustices and
calling folks to action when we have influence and authority. This is in letting righteous rule
infractions slide when we are in positions of enforcement. This is in using our skills, abilities,
and specializations honed in our workplace to contribute to action at the community level.

Not one community organizer is looking for "capital allocation mechanism design", but they are
looking for data aggregators and infrastructure runners.

## Mutual Aid as the Basis of Revolution

I'm not of the belief that any institution will save us; state, corporate, capitalist,
marxist-lenninist, or otherwise. I retain hope that we can effect change with active participation
and engagement with government, but I hold no illusions about its historical shortcomings and its
systemic oppression of the out-group of the time. In particular with the united states' government's
oppression of the indigenous, black, mexican, venezuelan, cuban, japanese, korean, vietnamese,
chinese, and queer communities throughout its history and including to this day. First and foremost
we have to take care of ourselves and our peoples without the institutions as much as it is feasible
to do so.

Peter Kropotkin, a Russian anarchist from the late 1800's contends that our evolutionary advantage
is primarily in our mutual aid. From "Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution":

> The animal species \[...\] in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest limits
> \[...\] and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development \[...\] are
> invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further progress. The
> mutual protection which is obtained in this case, the possibility of attaining old age and of
> accumulating experience, the higher intellectual development, and the further growth of sociable
> habits, secure the maintenance of the species, its extension, and its further progressive
> evolution. The unsociable species, on the contrary, are doomed to decay.

Our advantage is in our mutual interdependence. Working with and depending on one another. We can't
fix everything and there's only one game in town, but growing food for and with our communities,
building and running sovereign infrastructure which minimizes state or corporate dependence, sharing
our resources and knowledge with one another. These are how we make a difference right now in our
own communities. Despite the technological wonders I've had the privilege of interfacing with in my
time as a software engineer, there exists no more effective means of activation than distributing
zines and flyers, there exists no more effective means of organization than book reading and
in-person discourse, there exists no more effective means of mobilizing than getting out in these
streets and shouting with our low risk friends and engaging in non-violent direct action with our
high risk friends. Technology can facilitate positive change but the future is lower tech than you
think.

## The Shortcomings of Capital Incentives

We have failed time and time again to demonstrate the effectiveness of capital incentives as a means
of sustainable mechanism design among peers. The capital we own is a dot on the real number line and
nothing more. It's a point in a one-dimension topological space. Its failure to organize humans lies
in its failure to capture the complexity and extraordinarily high dimensionality that humans exhibit
in our behaviors, beliefs, and relationships. Neural networks are so powerful because of their high
dimensionality and ability to find closeness and connectedness in those high dimensions.

The creation of many currencies also fails to expand the dimensionality of capital as any
sufficiently liquid market makes each of these isomorphic, they all fall onto the same one-dimension
space.

No currency, no amount of capital can ever capture the essence of people who are down to stand off
unarmed against people armed with shotguns one day and plant seeds for the community the next.
No currency can ever represent the depth and complexity of our relationships with other people, with
the empathy we exhibit, with years-long commitments to common goals. The baseline assumption that we
intrinsically seek above all else to increase the one-dimensional number is flawed and outrageously
silly.

Capital incentives work for institutions and corporations because they have no soul, they have no
complexity of thought. The humans that work for them may, but the interests of the humans are
irrelevant under the fiduciary duty to maximize "shareholder value". Though even the game theory
underlying modern capital incentive mechanism design fails to recognize that any institution seeking
profits will undermine the game itself if the incentives so align. The intent market thesis is great
until the market maker cuts a backroom deal to get an advantage beyond the scope of the game theory.

We need more. We deserve more. We cannot depend on capital incentives as the basis for any action
which challenges the status quo of capital incentives.

## Going Forward

I won't be speaking on the petty actions of the capital owning class so much these days. I will not
forgive these institutions for that which they facilitate, but what we need is bigger and far more
important than them. Given the same systems and sets of circumstances, these mercenary organizations
were always going to exist. It's our job to transcend our disdain for them, to not be distracted by
what amounts to tales of the wild west, and to instead focus on transforming ourselves and our
communities in favor of resilience, sovereignty, fairness, equity, and mutual interdependence.

All power, to all the people. 💜
