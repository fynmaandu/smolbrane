Hi.

I write software, documentation, and technical articles.

I believe free and open source software is the means through which we combat technofeudalism through
radically minimalist technology, rejecting the convenience industrial complex in favor of software
which empowers the individual, facilitates emergent collaboration, and enables non-heirarchical
self-organizing groups beyond geographic boundaries.

**Action first, software second.**

## Cool People

### [Colin Roberts](https://autoparallel.xyz)

Kind of mathetician that manages to balance a deep stack of rigorous definitions with speaking like
a human about it. One of the very few people capable of explaining high concept abstract nonsense in
a way approachable to anyone willing to listen.

### [Sushi](https://fibered.cat)

Surprisingly scrappy engineer for someone so deep in categories and sheaves. Software ranges from
fast as hell simulation engines to frankly terrifying AI's capable of evasion. Prime example of
matheticians infusing software with edge.

### [Jepsen](https://github.com/0xJepsen)

Believes object oriented programming is an extension of the ego. Might have a zero day algebraic
attack against abelian discrete log problems on their computer. Great person to go on walks with and
a great person to plan categorical abstractions with.

### [Tim Clancy](https://github.com/TimTinkers)

Radical free and open source software activist. Once pinned software to a p2p network under threat
of legal action. Might literally die on an ideological hill one day.

### [PCaversaccio](https://pcaversaccio.com)

Security crisis response specialist and ideologue in free-time. Has probably seen more capital
hacked away and negotiated back than most see in a lifetime. Heard they debugged a compiler zero day
from a smart phone at a wedding before.
