<p>Radio communications is the backbone of all modern wireless
communications technology, from GSM cell networks and Wifi to amateur
radio and satellite telemetry.</p>
<p>Though most modern radio communications happen in standardized
frequencies with standardized hardware and protocols, amateur radio
operators are licensed to experiment with different frequencies,
modulation techniques, and hardware customization beyond standardized
products. Originally, amateur radio in the United States in particular,
was a civil defense organization. In times of crisis, public events, or
in the modern era, internet blackouts, amateur radio operators can form
networks of transmitters, receivers, and repeaters to create an adhoc
communications network.</p>
<p>In the following article, we’ll explore some of the introductory
concepts in the electromagnetic spectrum, antenna design, and modulation
techniques.</p>
<h2 id="the-electromagnetic-spectrum">The Electromagnetic Spectrum</h2>
<p>The electromagnetic spectrum is the basis for all modern wireless
communication including bluetooth, wifi, cell networks, radio, and
television, as well as the visible light spectrum, and even harmful
radiation such as ultraviolet and x-ray radiation. The differentiator
between each of these is the wave’s frequency, measured in oscillations
(or cycles) per second, denominated in Hertz (Hz). One Hz represents one
full sine wave per second, while one megahertz (MHz) represents one
million Hz per second.</p>

<p>Amateur radio operators and technicians also tend to further break
down the classes of electromagnetic energy into three sub ranges, the
High Frequency (HF), Very High Frequency (VHF), and Ultra High Frequency
(UHF) bands.</p>

<h3 id="radio-wave-propagation-phenomena">Radio Wave Propagation
Phenomena</h3>
<p>Different frequencies of electromagnetic radiation are affected by
different phenomena in our environment in different ways, though we can
broadly group these into the subranges mentioned above.</p>
<p>High Frequency (HF) waves can bounce off of the the “E” layer of the
ionosphere, an upper section of Earth’s atmosphere which is ionized
primarily by solar radiation. This is generally referred to as “sporadic
E” propagation, as the phenomena which affect the ionization of the
ionosphere can be sporadic. Sunspots, for example, increase and decrease
on an 11 year solar cycle and when there are more sunspots, the
ionization is stronger, and so is HF propagation. The aurora can
interfere with HF propagation, a phenomenon known as auroral scatter.
Precipitation in the troposphere often does not have significant effects
on HF propagation.</p>
<p>Very High Frequency (VHF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) are
generally only capable of line-of-sight communications, as they are
blocked by the curvature of the Earth and are not propagated by the
ionosphere. The maximum line-of-sight distance, also known as the radio
horizon, does extend further than the visual horizon, as the atmosphere
slightly refracts radio waves. VHF and UHF waves can be bounced off of
surfaces such as buildings or obstructions. They can also be diffracted
around sharp obstacles in a bizarre phenomenon called knife-edge
diffraction. Heavy vegetation and precipitation can absorb UHF waves.
However, auroral scatter can better propagate VHF/UHF, as can meteor
showers by bouncing waves off of the ionized tails of the meteors,
though the latter is quite sporadic. Troposcatter is the random scatter
of the troposphere which can propagate VHF further. Tropospheric ducting
can occur during a “temperature inversion”, where cold air is trapped
beneath warm air, and VHF signals can propagate much further.</p>
<p>Multipath distortion is a phenomenon where radio waves, through
scatter or through bouncing off of varying surfaces, arrive at a
receiver from different paths. This becomes a problem if the signals are
received in different phases or if the signals destructively interfere
with one another. Moving the transmitter or receive even a few meters
can drastically affect received signal strength.</p>
<h2 id="antennas">Antennas</h2>
<p>The way we transmit radio signals (typically frequencies up to
300GHz), is by creating a resonant circuit, that is a circuit with an
oscillating electromagnetic field, and an antenna to radiate its
electromagnetic energy.</p>
<p>When transmitted, electromagnetic waves consist of an electric field
and a magnetic field, which move perpendicular to one another.</p>
<!-- The  -->

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Electric and Magnetic Fields</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The polarization of an antenna indicates the angle at which the
electric field moves. Vertical polarization means the electric field is
radiated vertically and the magnetic field is radiated horizontally.
Horizontal polarization is the opposite of this. VHF and UHF antennas
transmit and receive signals at a much higher strength when
polarizations match.</p>
<p>Antennas should also be a length proportional to the wavelength.</p>
<p>Simple linear antennas include monopoles and dipoles. These interact
with the electric field and transmit strongest along their broadside.
The length of the simple linear antenna should be either the wavelength
or a fraction of it such as half or a quarter for better reception
quality.</p>

<p>Rubber ducky antennas are commonly seen on walkie talkies and other
more compact radio transceivers. These often have a thick plastic cover,
but underneath the antenna is short, often coiled, and loaded with an
inductor to better receive signals.</p>

<p>Phased array antennas are composed of multiple antennas laid out in a
two or three dimension array with relative phase offsets between them
such that their wave constructively and destructively interfere with one
another. Phase will be discussed in the phase modulation section below.
In some phased array antennas, the relative phases can be adjusted by an
electronic controller to create a beam of radiation via constructive
interference and even change its angles. Modern radar uses phased array
antennas to sweep the search space with a more powerful, focused beam of
electromagnetic energy.</p>

<p>There are other antennas such as loop antennas, helical antennas, and
many, many more, though these are beyond the scope of the article.</p>
<h2 id="modulation">Modulation</h2>
<p>Modulation is the process of altering the parameters of the
electromagnetic waves such that they carry information. A sine wave
alone carries no information aside from its parameters, that is
amplitude, phase, and frequency. We can manipulate each of these
parameters, as well as multiple parameters, to transmit information on
the electromagnetic radiation. The sine wave transmitted is known as the
carrier wave, while the wave which conveys information is the signal
wave, and the transmitted signal is a combination of the carrier wave
and the signal wave.</p>
<p>There are two broad classes of modulation techniques, analog and
digital. The analog signal wave corresponds to an analog signal such as
sound waves, while a digital signal wave may correspond to a given bit
or a series of bits.</p>
<h3 id="amplitude-modulation">Amplitude Modulation</h3>
<p>Amplitude modulation is the process of applying a signal wave to the
amplitude of the carrier wave, that is the amplitude or power of the
transmitted wave increases and decreases with the signal’s amplitude.
Amplitude modulation is common used in AM radio broadcasts, some
shortwave and HAM radio transceivers, aircraft radio, and in tandem with
other modulation methods, though this will be described in depth later
in the article.</p>
<p>The following is an example of analog amplitude modulation to
transmit a wave of lower frequency, such as that of a sound wave.</p>
<figure>
<img src="assets/am.png" alt="Amplitude Modulation Waves" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Amplitude Modulation Waves</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Additionally, we can use amplitude modulation for digital
transmissions, where an amplitude of zero is the zero bit and the
standard amplitude is the one bit. We refer to this as amplitude-shift
keying, as the amplitude maps to a “key” or a bit. ASK transmissions are
commonly used in transmitting over fiber optic cables.</p>
<p>Note how the signal wave is not a smooth wave, but rather a square
wave such that it is either in the zero or one position and note how
that affects the emitted wave.</p>
<figure>
<img src="assets/ask.png" alt="Amplitude-Shift Keyed Waves" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Amplitude-Shift Keyed Waves</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the above example, we transmit <code>1 0 1 1 0</code> and we use a
standard number of oscillations for each bit in a tradeoff between
bits-per-second transmitted and the probability that the receiver
received the correct sequence of bits. This can also be improved with
error correction strategies.</p>
<h3 id="frequency-modulation">Frequency Modulation</h3>
<p>Frequency modulation manipulates the carrier wave by increasing and
decreasing the carrier wave’s frequency via the signal wave. It is worth
mentioning that this takes up more bandwidth than amplitude modulation,
as a frequency modulated transmission must occupy multiple frequencies
throughout the transmission. This is often used for FM radio
broadcasting and shortwave radio communications. Note that frequency
modulation has a higher signal-to-noise ratio than amplitude modulation
with similar transmission power.</p>
<figure>
<img src="assets/fm.png" alt="Frequency Modulation Waves" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Frequency Modulation Waves</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Frequency-shift keying is similar to amplitude-shift keying, though
with frequency differences representing bits transmitted. FSK is used in
low frequency transmissions such as garage door openers, telemetry
systems, and weather balloons.</p>
<figure>
<img src="assets/fsk.png" alt="Frequency-Shift Keyed Waves" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Frequency-Shift Keyed Waves</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once again, we transmit <code>1 0 1 1 0</code> and we use a standard
number of oscillations in our transmissions.</p>
<h3 id="phase-modulation">Phase Modulation</h3>
<p>As a prerequisite, phase, in particular, refers to the offset of a
given sine wave from a reference sine wave. We represent phase in
degrees, where the phase offset between identical waves is 0° and the
phase offset between two opposite waves is 180°.</p>
<p>The following image is a blue reference wave and a red wave at a
phase offset of 45°.</p>
<figure>
<img src="assets/phase.png" alt="45° Phase Offset Between Sine Waves" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">45° Phase Offset Between Sine
Waves</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Phase modulation manipulates the relative phase of the carrier wave
with the signal wave. Analog phase modulation is possible, though it is
not commonly used in radio transmissions. Phase-shift keying, however,
is a critical component in modern radio communications systems such as
Wifi, GSM, Bluetooth, and more.</p>
<p>Note how when the bit changes from zero to one or one to zero, the
wave appears to invert and continue its oscillation from where it
inverted. The “signal” is explicitly in the <em>change</em> in
phase.</p>
<figure>
<img src="assets/bpsk.png" alt="Binary Phase-Shift Keyed Waves" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Binary Phase-Shift Keyed
Waves</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once again, we transmit <code>1 0 1 1 0</code> and we use a standard
number of oscillations in our transmissions.</p>
<p>Note that there are not only two phases in which a wave can exist,
our example above only uses binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), but we can
also use multiple phases such as quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK).
QPSK allows the signal wave to have four states instead of two (zero and
one). We can map each of the four states to a pair of bits:</p>
<ol class="incremental" type="1">
<li>0 0</li>
<li>0 1</li>
<li>1 0</li>
<li>1 1</li>
</ol>
<p>By using quadrature phase-shift keying, we can transmit double the
data for each phase shift, either increasing the bits-per-second
<em>or</em> increasing the redundancy in bits transmitted.</p>
<figure>
<img src="assets/qpsk.png" alt="Quadrature Phase-Shift Keyed Waves" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Quadrature Phase-Shift Keyed
Waves</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can represent these in an alternative diagram called the
constellation diagram. The constellation diagram maps the phase in the
sine wave to an angle on the unit circle.</p>
<p>In the binary phase-shift keying constellation diagram, the bits zero
and one are at phase offsets zero degrees and 180 degrees. In the
quadrature phase-shift keying constellation diagram, however, the pairs
of bits are at the offsets of 45, 90, 135, and 180 degrees. Each angle
represents a phase in the transmitted wave which represents some “keyed”
information.</p>
<figure>
<img src="assets/constellations.png"

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Binary and Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying
Constellations</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="quadrature-amplitude-modulation">Quadrature Amplitude
Modulation</h3>
<p>The cutting edge in modulation techniques includes the quadrature
amplitude modulation (QAM) strategy. We can combine the techniques of
amplitude-shift keying and phase-shift keying to create potentially many
combinations of bits to transmit at a time. 4-QAM is akin in
implementation to quadrature phase-shift keying, 16-QAM incorporates
phase and amplitude shifts, as does 32-QAM, 64-QAM, 128-QAM, and even
256-QAM! We can use a constellation diagram akin to the one above to
visually represent the collections of bits and how they may be mapped in
some of these schemes.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are many more topics that could be expanded upon here such as
multiplexing signals for increased bit rates, transforming signals into
the frequency domain with fast fourier transforms, error correction, new
improvements in the open source and public standardization space for
mesh networking, and much more. Though this article is getting long, so
this will be all for now.</p>
