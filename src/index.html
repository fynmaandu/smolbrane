hey there. if you're poking around for secret knowledge, here's some thoughts
i've been reflecting on. studying the movements for liberation throughout
american history in particular is incredibly insightful as to where we are,
where we're going, and how we can change the course of our own history.
electoral politics is for incremental changes, but incremental changes don't
work when hundreds of thousands of us die every year through systemic violence.
incremental changes don't work when the systems of oppression are fundamentally
at odds with the liberation of all peoples. we're not under a system of "right"
and "left", there is only one struggle; it is between those who capture power
and use it to subjugate people and the rest of us. capitalism is not the ends
but rather the means of subjugation. "free market" forces systemitize and codify
violence in a pseudo-justifiable package, labor outsourcing to places with weak
labor laws and often slavery subsidize our daily existence, and the forever
culture war is a means to direct our anger at one another instead of at those
who stand to lose the most in the dismantling of such systems of oppression.

it is entirely valid to criticize injustice without a clear and coherent
alternative in a rigorous and quasi-objective manner. all logical systems have
contradictions, all measurements are approximations, pure objectivity is not
real in any rigorous sense and the notion of objectivity, "common sense", and
logic are often misappropriated to perpetuate fallacies which prop up the
aforementioned systems of oppression.

with that said, i imagine a transitionary period in our very near future; as the
state increasingly serves the interests of capital over people, as the
corporations price out more of humanity, when the systems and infrastructure
has abandoned us to die, humanity will, on a longer time scale, flourish. food
sovereignty networks are under development now, with
gardeners and agro-ecologists growing food for the community without market
incentives. disaster response infrastructure with a basis in mutual aid is under
development now, with amateur radio operators and emergency response workers
creating strategies to best serve all peoples in the wake of accelerating
climate change. educational networks are underdeveloped but showed great promise
with the black panther party for self defense, the young lords party, and
similar organizations which sought to both better feed the children of the next
generation as well as educate them on the history that is not taught in public
or private school. the foundations are developing, there will come a time when
we have the mobility, the numbers, the infrastructure to peacefully transition
to a radical anti-capitalist, non-hierarchical society. one in which the state
does not regulate us, one in which market forces don't enslave us, one in which
we are free to engage in labor with our communities, freely associate with
organizations of peoples, and pursue our highest forms of personal and communal
development. a library economy offers a glimpse into such a system, where the
means obtaining the necessities for survival are managed by collective
participation, the commons maintained by social contract and collective
contribution, and the reusable and shareable resources managed by a catalog;
items are rented and returned freely without charge, communal governance
communicates collective expectations, addresses bad behavior, and seeks to
assist those who engage in such behavior.

if you are willing and able, reach out to local initiatives which move toward
this future, our people are out there, we only need to help. all power, to all
the people. peace 💜

<p>Hi, I'm Riley.</p>
<p>I am a mutual aid farmer, FPV drone pilot, and a migrant rights
activist. I also write software.</p>
<p>I believe that
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free and open source
software</a> is a profound and radical movement among software engineers
which can transform how we organize and mobilize, but the digital is useful
only to the extent that it facilitates the material.
</p>
<p>We cannot supplement community with technology, we must organize first
for the liberation of <strong>all peoples</strong> and optimize these
processes second.

<p>Surprisingly scrappy engineer for someone so deep in categories and
sheaves. Software ranges from fast as hell simulation engines to frankly
terrifying AI’s capable of evasion. Prime example of matheticians
infusing software with edge.</p>

<p>Radical free and open source software activist. Once pinned software

<p>Security crisis response specialist and ideologue in free-time. Has
probably seen more money hacked away and negotiated back than most see
in a lifetime. Heard they debugged a compiler zero day from a smart
phone at a wedding before.</p>
<h3 id="catherine"><a

<p>Writer, designer, artist, undercover polyglot. Doesn't use the formal
language of the matheticians but seems to have found the isomorphisms
and homotopies of reality engaging with the metaphysical. Surprisingly
level-headed for an ideologue of similar belief.
</p>
<h3 id="redacted">[redacted]</h3>
<p>Nameless for the purpose of opsec, [redacted] has an aptitude and
willingness to disrupt and antagonize systems of oppression without
regard for scale or threat to personal safety, yet they contribute
constructively to the most radical and revolutionary systems I have
seen in the wild.
