Let us begin with textbook quantization, and let's get it cleared upfront that there is nothing new about "second quantization"
- just uplift the Poisson bracket to the commutator (this has many issues, will elaborate later). Well, this naive way didn't cause us any issue
  in the usual QM, because the kind of systems we quantized were as simple as a harmonic oscillator - whose solutions (classically) are smooth functions - literally a sinusoid
  But now, for a field theory, the solutions were integrals of Green's functions with a given source term. Even this is not problematic, but when we have to define a Poisson bracket
, that's where the issues seep in; we are taking derivatives of a distribution. This is the reason we even end up naively seeing δ(x-y) = {Φ,π} --> [Φ,π] = iδ(x-y). <b>Most of this is ill-defined.</b> 
</p>
<pre>
1. First reason is that the Poisson bracket evaluated using functional derivatives would be wrong here, because due to infinite degrees of freedom,
   the symplectic form is degenerate and even if it weren't, there is still no guarantee that the inverse of the symplectic form exists.
   So this {Φ,π} = ill defined.
2. If you are unaware of symplectic structure fine, let's believe [Φ,π] = iδ(x-y). Now when I actually want to write some quantity Φ(x) = ?
   The standard idea would be to talk about Fourier modes (decomposed into +ve and -ve energy) Φ = ∫(ψaᶧ+ ψ*a) or = ∑ (ψaᶧ+ ψ*a) for periodic condition.
   Who said these integrals or sums would converge - they wont. <b>It's not a legit operator.</b>
</pre>  
<p> (Φ,π) could've been smooth functions in special cases and they commute classically, but why would I assume suddenly in Quantum theory I can't multiply them as I want, 
  or use them directly as observables? <b>Deformation:</b> This is the prescription which gives an intuitive feel (and makes things mathematically very rigorous - so much so that
  we haven't worked it out completely for many observables) we say that insted of randomly jumping from poisson bracket, which is nothing like multplying two objects in differeny order.
  We say that add the quantum corrections to the classical solutions Φπ --> Φ⋆π = Φπ + h() + h^2() ... so we are actually defining a new kind of ()⋆() product.  Where the first order in
  planck's constant correction is defined as the poisson bracket. Now the second quantization is much more digestable.

  But this hasn't yet solved the problem that poisson bracket was ill defined. Now enters the concept of <b>smearing</b> --> Φ(f) := ∫Φ(x)f(x)dx, which smoothens out rough edges
  (i.e tames the singularities) and makes sure the Poisson bracket can be well defined - earlier w/o smearing, we can't even define Φ(x) as an observable on classical phase space - because the vector
  which generates this observable as a flow doesn't lie in the phase space at all.
