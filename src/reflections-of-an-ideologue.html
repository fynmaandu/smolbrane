<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I would define a large component of my personal “brand”,
historically, as one of ideological ramblings and lashing out at the
powers that be. I’ve burned bridges, severed friendships, alienated
countless people, and hopefully inspired countless more. In taking time
away and reflecting I think the basis for these criticisms was wrong.
The problems we face are bigger than a16z, coinbase, paradigm; they’re
bigger than bank of america, blackrock, palantir. These may be the
organizations which oppose us in the moment, but our problem is not in
implementation details, it is systemic. Given the same circumstances,
banks, centralized exchanges, intermediaries, these will all exist. If
not the name brands we know, then others. A bet on benevolence up the
hierarchy is a bet on the protocol with all the technicals and none of
the culture. If we ejected all police officers and put new ones in their
place today, the oppression of minorities would not stop. If the
president of the united states stepped down today, the mass deportation
of migrants would not stop. Our problems are systemic. Barring some
fantasy revolution where we all put down our laptops and uber eats to
fight up in the hills to magically overthrow everything and completely
fix all the systemic problems that a subsequent government would almost
certainly inherit; we have to rethink how revolutionary and radical
action is taken. There’s too many lives at stake, too much capital
unwilling to budge, too many institutions in too many places. If we
break it we starve, so we change it and ourselves continuously.</p>
<h2 id="revolution-as-continuous-transformation">Revolution as
Continuous Transformation</h2>
<p>We think of revolution as a short series of discrete, significant
actions. The boston tea party, the export of cryptography on t-shirts
protected by the constitution, the black panther party for self defense
walking into the capitol of california with rifles and shotguns.
Dramatic moments worthy of cinematic re-enactment.</p>
<p>But this is not what revolution is. Revolution is countless small
changes in our day to day which continuously transform ourselves and the
systems under which we live. For those not interested in topology, the
handwavy “continuous transformation” wording means we’re not tearing
apart ourselves and “the systems”, we’re bending, folding, stretching,
squeezing to better meet the needs of our fellow people.</p>
<p>Those of us with privilege and authority under the socioeconomic
order find ourselves with the responsibility to start the revolution
where we are. This is in speaking out about injustices and calling folks
to action when we have influence and authority. This is in letting
righteous rule infractions slide when we are in positions of
enforcement. This is in using our skills, abilities, and specializations
honed in our workplace to contribute to action at the community
level.</p>
<p>Not one community organizer is looking for “capital allocation
mechanism design”, but they are looking for data aggregators and
infrastructure runners.</p>
<h2 id="mutual-aid-as-the-basis-of-revolution">Mutual Aid as the Basis
of Revolution</h2>
<p>I’m not of the belief that any institution will save us; state,
corporate, capitalist, marxist-lenninist, or otherwise. I retain hope
that we can effect change with active participation and engagement with
government, but I hold no illusions about its historical shortcomings
and its systemic oppression of the out-group of the time. In particular
with the united states’ government’s oppression of the indigenous,
black, mexican, venezuelan, cuban, japanese, korean, vietnamese,
chinese, and queer communities throughout its history and including to
this day. First and foremost we have to take care of ourselves and our
peoples without the institutions as much as it is feasible to do so.</p>
<p>Peter Kropotkin, a Russian anarchist from the late 1800’s contends
that our evolutionary advantage is primarily in our mutual aid. From
“Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The animal species […] in which individual struggle has been reduced
to its narrowest limits […] and the practice of mutual aid has attained
the greatest development […] are invariably the most numerous, the most
prosperous, and the most open to further progress. The mutual protection
which is obtained in this case, the possibility of attaining old age and
of accumulating experience, the higher intellectual development, and the
further growth of sociable habits, secure the maintenance of the
species, its extension, and its further progressive evolution. The
unsociable species, on the contrary, are doomed to decay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our advantage is in our mutual interdependence. Working with and
depending on one another. We can’t fix everything and there’s only one
game in town, but growing food for and with our communities, building
and running sovereign infrastructure which minimizes state or corporate
dependence, sharing our resources and knowledge with one another. These
are how we make a difference right now in our own communities. Despite
the technological wonders I’ve had the privilege of interfacing with in
my time as a software engineer, there exists no more effective means of
activation than distributing zines and flyers, there exists no more
effective means of organization than book reading and in-person
discourse, there exists no more effective means of mobilizing than
getting out in these streets and shouting with our low risk friends and
engaging in non-violent direct action with our high risk friends.
Technology can facilitate positive change but the future is lower tech
than you think.</p>
<h2 id="the-shortcomings-of-capital-incentives">The Shortcomings of
Capital Incentives</h2>
<p>We have failed time and time again to demonstrate the effectiveness
of capital incentives as a means of sustainable mechanism design among
peers. The capital we own is a dot on the real number line and nothing
more. It’s a point in a one-dimension topological space. Its failure to
organize humans lies in its failure to capture the complexity and
extraordinarily high dimensionality that humans exhibit in our
behaviors, beliefs, and relationships. Neural networks are so powerful
because of their high dimensionality and ability to find closeness and
connectedness in those high dimensions.</p>
<p>The creation of many currencies also fails to expand the
dimensionality of capital as any sufficiently liquid market makes each of
these isomorphic, they all fall onto the same one-dimension space.</p>
<p>No currency, no amount of capital can ever capture the essence of
people who are down to stand off unarmed against people armed with
shotguns one day and plant seeds for the community the next. No currency
can ever represent the depth and complexity of our relationships with
other people, with the empathy we exhibit, with years-long commitments
to common goals. The baseline assumption that we intrinsically seek
above all else to increase the one-dimensional number is flawed and
outrageously silly.</p>
<p>Capital incentives work for institutions and corporations because
they have no soul, they have no complexity of thought. The humans that
work for them may, but the interests of the humans are irrelevant under
the fiduciary duty to maximize “shareholder value”. Though even the game
theory underlying modern capital incentive mechanism design fails to
recognize that any institution seeking profits will undermine the game
itself if the incentives so align. The intent market thesis is great
until the market maker cuts a backroom deal to get an advantage beyond
the scope of the game theory.</p>
<p>We need more. We deserve more. We cannot depend on capital incentives
as the basis for any action which challenges the status quo of capital
incentives.</p>
<h2 id="going-forward">Going Forward</h2>
<p>I won’t be speaking on the petty actions of the capital owning class
so much these days. I will not forgive these institutions for that which
they facilitate, but what we need is bigger and far more important than
them. Given the same systems and sets of circumstances, these mercenary
organizations were always going to exist. It’s our job to transcend our
disdain for them, to not be distracted by what amounts to tales of the
wild west, and to instead focus on transforming ourselves and our
communities in favor of resilience, sovereignty, fairness, equity, and
mutual interdependence.</p>
<p>All power, to all the people. 💜</p>
