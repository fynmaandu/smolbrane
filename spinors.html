<p>Let us dive into it from the perspective of a relativist and motivate it instead of defining it as is</p>
<p>Consider something called a celestial sphere, which contains all the events you can see at one instant of time (in principle - can't do anything if you have myopia, yikes)</p>
<p>This collection of events (from whom the light ray originated) forms a sphere in the past - this can be understood by the equation for a null ray:</p>
<p>dt^2 = constant =  dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2            [This is our good old equation for a sphere]</p>  
<p>In many texts you will find the use of stereographic projections - but why do we need it when we just have a sphere already?</p>  
<p>Until next time.</p>
